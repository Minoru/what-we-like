* Create a favicon
* Design a proper page404
* Return HTTP Code "Gone" for images that were cached but were since evicted
  from the cache (this situation will be easy to detect if we use monotonically
  increasing numbers for image filenames)
* Strip the site down before GitHub release:
    * remove unnecessary dependencies
    * clean up the config
    * remove all code I don't need
    * revise comments in the code and configs—are they relevant to the project?
* Learn to filter out things that don't contain an image, like "Switching to
  HTTPS" announcement in my favourites
* Decide what I'm going to do with robots: disllow them, welcome them, or what.
* Do not fetch images that we already have
* Save E-Tag and Last-Modified header values, send them with each request to
  save bandwidth
* Remove that `take 3` call to make the server truly useful :)
* Make link field in Deviaiton table unique
* Make both name and feed_url fields in rss_feed table unique
* Pull author's name from media:credit, but be careful—there are two entries,
  one of which is an avatar (an HTTPS URL) and another is a name
* Show images in reverse order (latest first)
* Add pagination
    * Decide if I want infinite scroll (load next image automatically) or
      manual pagination ("Next" button at the end of the page)
