* Create a favicon
* Design a proper page404
* Return HTTP Code "Gone" for images that were cached but were since evicted
  from the cache (this situation will be easy to detect if we use monotonically
  increasing numbers for image filenames)
* Strip the site down before GitHub release:
    * remove unnecessary dependencies
    * clean up the config
    * remove all code I don't need
    * revise comments in the code and configsâ€”are they relevant to the project?
